This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in India, leveraging Business Intelligence to identify key factors influencing prices. 
Built using Python, it employs libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
The project implements Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Hyperparameter Testing, and Decision Trees to develop a robust predictive model.
By analyzing various features and trends, the model aims to provide accurate house price forecasts. 
The project is designed to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate market.
Key Insights Gained From the Project:
(i)Out of the 6 Important Metropolitan Cities in India,the house prices in Delhi are the highest.
(ii)Another interesting obervation is that,Kolkata where the house prices are clearly less when compared to Delhi and Mumbai ,still has the Rajarahat and New Town among the top ten property locations in India.
This clearly demonstrates the wide disparity that exists when it comes to valuation of top property locations in India, and it is also an indirect indication of the complicated Real -Estate Market that exists
in India.
(iii)A different aspect of analysis demonstrates that across the cities in consideration,in general the predicted house prices of the newly constructed ones are higher when compared to the houses that are resold.This is quite natural as most of the owners prefer to buy establish new properties over the ones that are sold for the second time.
(iv)Another intriguing aspect to notice is that we can understand that the two-bedroom houses ,and three-bedroom houses are the ones that are highly concentrated in the metropolitan Indian cities, the concentration of one-bedroom houses and four-bedroom houses though less are not as least as the five-bedroom and six-bedroom houses.This is a clear indication of the largely middle-class and upper-middle class Indian society. On the other hand the one-room houses indicates the economically weaker and impoverished sections of Indian society which cumulatively account to be the lower class of Indian Society.A slightly different aspect to be noticed is the marginal concentration of five and six-bedroom houses which are the richer sections of the society.
